Google_Play_Store

Data cleaning 
The first step was to ensure that my dataset was clean and ready for exploration therefore I used Excel first to identify the potential anomalies 
in my dataset then used python to clean them.

Data Exploration
The following questions were answered:

1. What are the top categories in google play store?
2. What is the percentage of installed apps in each category? 
3. Perecentage of free and paid apps?
4. Percentage of installed free and paid apps?
5. Popular categories among paid apps?
6. Percentage of intsalled paid apps categories?
7. Average, minimum and maximum apps prices?
8. Information about the top 10 paid apps?
9. Percentage of Apps content rating? 
10. What is the top content rating in paid apps? 
11. What is the percentage of installed apps in each content rating category? 
12. What are the top reviewed categories?
